# This weather application includes all the features you requested:

# Styled Weather Display

I've used clean fonts and improved spacing for better readability
The weather data is organized in a grid layout with consistent styling
Each weather detail has its own card with proper alignment


# Refresh Button:
Added a refresh button at the bottom of the weather container
It remembers the last searched city and refreshes data without re-entering the city name
The button has a nice hover effect and includes a refresh icon


# Weather Icons

Implemented icons using Font Awesome that represent different weather conditions
Icons change based on the weather condition code returned by the API
The icons are prominently displayed alongside the temperature


# Responsive Design

Used media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes
On smaller screens, the layout changes to a more vertical flow
The search box and details grid adjust based on screen width


# Loading Indicator

Added a spinning animation that shows while fetching weather data
The loading state hides the weather container and error messages
A message accompanies the spinner to inform users that data is loading



# How to Use:

Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the JavaScript file with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key
Save all three files in the same directory
Open the HTML file in a browser

'''The app is clean, well-organized, and follows all your requirements. The code is also structured in a way that makes it easy to maintain and extend with additional features if needed.'''
